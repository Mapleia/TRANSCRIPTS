hey guys welcome back to my channel my name is Manny anyway for those of you who might not know who I am thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it um so today's video is a video I should have made a lot earlier and I should have addressed things a lot sooner so last night mmm Gabriel Zamora uploaded a video titled my truth and it was a video about the situation happened last week about a photo that me Nikita Laura and Gabi were in flipped using or flipping off the camera being like this and with the intention that board was intended to recreate Kylie's 21st birthday photo you know we took a bunch of them and then we were just [ __ ] around after because we're all friends and that's what we were just doing we're just like oh you know and he spoke about him writing this narrative that he that we had no idea that this photo was going to be posted and it was gonna be used in the context that it did that is very true we didn't I watched Gabby's video and first and four before I even get in to the video I want to apologize to Gabby because watching that video I can see the hurt in his eyes and I understand where he's coming from 100% and looking back I would change things if I could if I could you know Gabby said Manny you know Manny showed up at my house wanting to talk it's true I did I texted Gabby asking how he was how he was once I realized what I had done as a person as a friend to him I texted him right away I called him I voiced him with him I drove to his house I tried my best to rectify a situation that I [ __ ] up in and I know that I [ __ ] up I was still so hurt and so upset and so mad so mad at the fact that this photo even went up in the first place and my mind I thought how could a friend do this to us how could a friend do this to me how can he put up a photo like this with all of us writing his own narrative it was selfish in my head I was thinking it's selfish there's no way he would do this like this is not something he ever would do and I was in denial and the reason I haven't talked about this photo or apologized for this photo was because I was being prideful and that's just the [ __ ] fact of the matter I was being prideful and I thought to myself I didn't do anything wrong it was a miscommunication it was a misunderstanding why would I apologize for a miscommunication that I had no part of and I didn't know was going up but looking back at the situation I did have a part of it I was involved in it I was in the photo I liked the photo and the fact that I was part of it in any way shape or form is what I needed to own up to I wasn't I wasn't allowing myself to own up to it because I was being so [ __ ] prideful and I was like no I didn't post this I didn't know I was being posted that's not fair why should I why should I apologize you know I didn't do anything wrong I have no qualms with Jeffery I don't I let Jeffery live his life and live it happily if I would have known that photo was gonna be used for what it was used for I would have never done it I would have never posed for that photo because I don't want to come across negative and do these things that's not what I wanted I didn't want Jeffery to get hurt I wanted to feel bullied in any way shape or form that's not what I wanted Gabby also talked about in his video about a pattern a pattern that I have and that really hit hard that really [ __ ] hit hard to me because him talking about my track record you know talking about the other relationships in my life you know talking about look at the things man he said look at his track record look who he is as a person you know if [ __ ] hurts but seeing that it's the truth it hurts but it's the [ __ ] truth sorry I'm getting a little intense Gabby was talking about pattern that I have with my friendships you know and he's talking about to French's specifically and he's talking about Patrick Starr and he's talking about Geoffrey start and he's talking about himself of course as well and that's what it is I have had bad track records with other friends of mine in private yes but they were still bad track records in in itself you know talking about Patrick for example Patrick introduced me to the beauty world he was the one that really got me into it he's the one that inspired me I have the looks on my Instagram still to this day that were inspired by Patrick you know Patrick is someone who I was so inspired by and we became friends and we grew together and we learn from one another and we were so close we were so close but just like friendships that happen every day of our lives we had miscommunications we had missteps I heard him at the end of the day friendship is a two-way street I was internally hurting as well you know and due to the fact that I am a terrible communicator and the fact that I am so bad at conveying my emotion to my friends in real life because I want them to be happy I want them to like me you know I want them to see the best version of me possible I don't want to ever talk to them in a negative way I never wanted to have them see me in a bad light and so I would rather push them away then we have a confrontation with them I am not good with confrontation in the slightest I'm actually [ __ ] terrible at it and this situation that's happened has really brought it to light to me that is what I've done passion was hurt by was something I did you know by our friendship and what happened between us and for that I am sorry I'm sorry to Patrick you know me and Patrick I hold no ill will to Patrick whatsoever I've made videos on his collaborations I've talked about his collaborations whenever I see him I hug him I say hello you know and even though we aren't close like we once were I still wish him the best I truly truly do and if I could go back in time and help mend my relationship with Patrick you know have us go through our dark times I would do it everything differently I would be a better communicator I would tell him things that were affecting me and were hurting me and I would open up and not just internalize them and have a [ __ ] meltdown in my mind I would talk about things and talk about my emotions and my feelings because in turn me thinking that walking away would save the friendship and turn destroyed it and destroyed all my friendships in that way you know not owning up to my [ __ ] that hurts people so now regarding Jeffery this is a big a big topic this is something that people have been asking me and asking me to asking him for so long to talk about as to why we were no longer friends why we are no longer close what's going on between us what's the tea what's going on there were things mutually done to one another that hurt the other you know and the fact that we didn't communicate that to each other better it's truly where I feel like our downfall was was our lack of communication and the fact that we didn't we were not able to communicate to each other how we were truly feeling you know Jeffrey has done oh my goodness I can't even explain Jeffrey has done so much for me in my life you know I would would not be who I where I am today without Jeffrey Jeffrey has helped me in insurmountable ways he truly truly has and just like Patrick if I can go back and fix things with Jeffrey I would I really really would because how he felt how he feels it's not right it's like we never had closure you know last year me and Jeffrey had a heart-to-heart around November and I went over to his place and we wanted to talk about certain things you know we wanted to talk about things of why we were in this weird funk but I wasn't able to open up like I wanted to and I wasn't able to accept the things that he was telling me I wasn't able to accept it you know and I take full responsibility you know for that and for me not being a better communicator and for me not believing in him when there were certain things that were going down you know at enmity to the things that have happened between us all those are things that have happened between us you know I never wanted to take this to social media I never wanted to talk about this you know these relationships that I've had with these people these people that were in my life and I loved so much these were private things things were things I never wanted to talk about these are never the things I wanted to speak about because that was a relationship between me and Jeffrey not Manny anyway and Jeffrey start it was between me and Jeffrey was between me and Patrick I was between me and Gabi those are things that I wanted to keep private and hidden you know and yes even though we had our differences and we had our miscommunications and we had our missteps and we are no longer hosts like we once were there was a mutual understanding that I didn't want to go out and publicly bash anyone and talk and negatively about anything have I been Shady along the way and like with tweets and likes and things like that absolutely everyone has all of us have you know and that's just human nature to be Petty and being a [ __ ] [ __ ] honestly being a [ __ ] [ __ ] and that's what I was I was being a [ __ ] [ __ ] you know you guys I have not reached out to Jeffrey about the situation I've not reached out to Patrick about this I have reach out to Gabriel and he shut me out and that's okay because he's hurt by something that I've done and I understand that and I take full [ __ ] responsibility for what I did to him and hurting him by liking tweets by responding to things you know that I can't even explain how mad at myself I am about this because that's the last thing I want I don't want to lose a [ __ ] friend I don't want to lose another friend that's the last thing I wanted you know which is why I was trying so hard to mend it and fix things but I understand I understand if you happy does not want to fix things I understand that is him that is his truth and he if he's happier without me when his life then so be it so be it but I have not reached out to Patrick and I have not reached out to Geoffrey yet I didn't want it to seem like it was dissing genuine like I was only reaching out because of all this [ __ ] coming up now you know maybe in the future we can talk with Patrick for example I just saw him at VidCon recently and it was a great experience we took photos together and it was great we just talked and just sat and chilled you know and that's what I want you know we might not be best friends we might be close anymore but the fact that we actually have a working relationship now and we're able to see each other and be genuinely happy when we see each other that is what I wanted and that's what we have and with Jeffery the reason I didn't apologize or talk about it sooner because I really in my bones felt I had did nothing wrong I did not post this photo I did not know this photo was being posted you know I liked it unlike did and my pride to go on the way and I didn't reach out to Jeffery and I didn't talk to him you know and that's what happened you know we might not be as close as we once were but he is living his life happily and I'm living my life happily and that's all I want recently Alicia Marie posted a video and it was about like the dark side about YouTube and just kind of talking about what other influence or you know we're talking about the other end of YouTube with other influencers and in that video I literally say how grateful I am to Jeffery for introducing me to a lab that I use I do not wish any ill-will on Jeffrey or Patrick or Gabriel I don't I want them to be happy I want them to be happy you know even though I was a shitty [ __ ] friend to them you know maybe that's why I wants me to be so happy is because I was because I because of my own shortcomings as a person and as a human being to them because I wasn't there for them and I was a shitty friend you know looking back looking back at everything communication is everything you guys it is everything when I tell you that communication is the most important thing it truly is you need to be able to communicate and evoke your emotion or else you will not be able to flourish in relationships and I really feel like that was a big downfall and all three of my friendships was Gabi Jeffery and Patrick I wasn't able to convey how I felt and that's a big reason why it ended and why I slid back and why I took a step back from the situation I was like no I would rather you know step away then confront them and tell them how I'm feeling you know you guys confrontation really brings out a bad side of me and by that I mean my anxiety and my depression and confrontation really brings my anxiety to a whole new level and I think to myself if I'm not confronting this person that's hurt me it's fine because I'm not gonna be feeling anxious and I can just kind of back away and I can try to mend their friendship from afar but it never gets mended because I swept it under the rug I swept it under the rug and that's what it was I slept all my friendships under the rug because I wasn't able to talk about them even making this video right now I'm shaking it's so hard for me to talk about these things it's hard to talk about you failing as a friend it's hard to talk about you failing as a human and it's hard to talk about you failing to your audience and that's what I feel like I feel like I have failed you I feel like I've truly failed you guys so much and that's the last thing I want is to fail you guys you know you guys this has been one of the most life-changing things that's ever happened to me in my entire life is this situation that has happened to me you know it's it's made me really who I am as a person Who I am as a friend who I am as a sibling who I am as a son you know and I've talked to my parents about this you know I I'm at my parents house right now actually this is why they said it looks a little weird because I've been here for the past two days just reflecting and talking to them you know my parents even told me I was tough love Oh tough love is a very real ask my parents what they thought of me and what they think about the situation and what they think in general and they say that I've changed my own parents told me that I've changed and hearing that was a whole heart breaking you know then tell me that I've got swept up in LA you know swept up in the numbers and the views and the subs you know and I feel it and I know that's the truth you know and that's why it hit me so hard it's cuz I know it's the truth I started social media when I was 21 and I wanted to do it because I was a little scared gay boy who was just coming out of the closet not knowing what to do who loved makeup that's why I started social media in the first place now that I'm 27 it's got it was such a different level you know and I feel like I've been losing myself in this I have lost who I was when I was 21 and I lost and I know I've grown and I bettered myself along the way but some of the changes I've made have not been for the better you know and that means me changing for my parents to tell me that I've changed and they worry for me everyday and they pray that I don't get swept up in LA and that that was any wake-up call to say the least because your parents are never gonna sugarcoat anything for you they're gonna lay know what the [ __ ] is up and they told me that and I was not ready for it I was not ready to be hearing but I needed to hear it you know I needed to hear I needed to hear I need I need four people in my life to keep me accountable you know and even though I was hurt by Gaby's video I needed to watch it I needed to see how he was feeling because I didn't know I didn't know how I was coming across to him you know I didn't know that he felt that way about me and I didn't know he felt hurt and now watching that video I know that he felt her and he was upset and he was devastated by what I did to him and he felt alone and he felt abandoned as a friend and watching that I completely agree singing from his view and his lens that is 100% true I would have thought my friends abandoned me as well that wasn't my intention but that's what happened just like the situations with Jeffery with Patrick I never meant to hurt them I just did know how to communicate with them that I was hurting as well and this has been a huge life lesson to me you guys at the end of the day I need to take responsibility for my actions and the things that I do and for the human that I am and who I'm becoming that's why I'm making this video I need to take respond to super sponsibility for myself and as someone who's in the public eye I shouldn't know better I should be better than what I am right now I should be so much better for you guys for my audience for the people that love me for the people that care about me for my family for my friends and that's the reason I'm making this video is because I want to own up to my shortcomings as a friend and as a human and as a person you know in and you know thinking about it I'm disappointed in myself there's no other words to say other than the fact that I am truly disappointed with myself in this situation and I understand that you guys are disappointed in me and I get it because I'm disappointed in myself and I'm disappointed how I've treated my friends because they didn't deserve that and that's not what a real friend does there by your side 100% and I'm still by Gabriel side I'm still by Nikita side I'm still by Laura side and I love them and I wish I could take it all back but I can't and I need to own up to what the [ __ ] I've done and my responsibility so you guys I'm gonna be taking a little break and just really reflecting on myself and seeing where the [ __ ] I've become you know why why have my priorities changed why am I in social media to know why who do I want to be what do I want to do with my life and those are the questions I need to ask and I needed to be answered for myself as a human and as a person I need to know those things and I don't know those things right now you know like I said I felt like I was getting lost in the views and the subs in the clout and I was like oh it doesn't matter I can do something later because I just needed to film this video real quick first you know that's a big struggle of mine and that was becoming the only struggle of mine you know I wouldn't let going to see my family in San Diego I haven't been assigned you go since December and it was because I was so focused on being LA being Manny Mui being this person who continuously uploads and kills himself to get content out and you know always trying to find the next best thing and wants to get likes and views and subs but this situation at hand has really helped me realize what's important you know and that's my family and that's my health and that's you guys I have a lot to work on as a human and as a person and I do try my best that I can safer with a full open heart and open mind hand to the Bible to God I do try my best to be the best person that I can be but sometimes it's not enough and you need to do more and even though in my heart I know that I thought I did what's best in every scenario that I was in that wasn't enough and people got her and for that I am sorry I'm sorry that people got hurt you know it's never my intention but that's what happened and I take full ownership of that and that's why I'm gonna go on a little break right now you know and really just do some soul-searching and figure out who I want to be from this and I will be back stronger and a better person and a better friend and a better human from this so I love you guys so much more than words can describe truly you guys have been there for me when people in my life were not when my family was not and I hope you guys will be here for me through this as well and if you would cannot be I understand I do you know I've failed you and if you feel like I'm not someone you want to follow anymore I understand I truly do and I want you guys to know that I'm going to continue to do my best because that's all I can do is try my best so um thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you guys when I'm able to see you guys
